# Deploying DeepSeek R1 with Azure AI Foundry: System Thinking & Token Utilization in Web Chatbots


To implement DeepSeek R1 with Azure AI Foundry while integrating System Thinking and analyzing Token Utilization, follow these steps:

1. Set Up Azure AI Foundry
Create an Azure Account: If you don't have one, sign up for an Azure subscription.
Create a Project: Log in to the Azure AI Foundry portal and create a new project.
2. Deploy DeepSeek R1
Add the Model: Navigate to the model catalog and add DeepSeek R1 to your project.
Configure Deployment: Set up the necessary resources and configure the model deployment using the Azure AI Inference SDK or REST APIs.
3. Integrate System Thinking
Define Parameters: Incorporate system thinking principles by defining parameters that consider the broader system interactions and dependencies.
Model Configuration: Adjust the model configuration to include these parameters, ensuring the model's outputs are aligned with system thinking.
4. Analyze Token Utilization
Monitor Token Usage: Use Azure AI Foundry's monitoring tools to track token usage for each request. This includes setting up alerts and visualizations to monitor token consumption.
Optimize Requests: Analyze the token usage data to optimize your requests, ensuring efficient use of tokens and cost management4.
